Panther Pathways

Your Path. Your Start. Your Panther Story.

Panther Pathways is a student-friendly onboarding guide designed to help new GSU international freshmen navigate academics, housing, communication, safety, and essential campus logistics.
This project was created as part of my Panther LEAP Capstone, focusing on the C: Community pillar through practical support resources for incoming students.

📌 Overview

This site organizes must-know information for new students into clear, simple sections:

Week 1 Essentials: Tasks and deadlines every freshman should track.

GSU Housing Overview: Key processes, move-in guidance, and campus expectations.

Emergency Contacts: High-visibility access to urgent numbers for the Atlanta campus.

Communication Templates: Email scripts and message starters for professors, offices, and support services.

Registration & Holds: Step-by-step breakdowns of the most common administrative issues.

Banking, SIM, Food, and City Basics: Straightforward explanations for international students adapting to the U.S.

All content is structured for clarity so students can make decisions fast without getting buried in scattered information.
